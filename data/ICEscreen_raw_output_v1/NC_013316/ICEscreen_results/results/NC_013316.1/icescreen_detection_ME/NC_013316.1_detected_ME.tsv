The now former ICE / IME structure __IMEICEID_BasicEMStructure__7__ (CDR20291_RS09835, CDR20291_RS09900, CDR20291_RS09960) is being merged into the ICE / IME structure ID_1 (CDR20291_RS09505 [Pseudo]).

The SP CDR20291_RS09625 could be attributed to the ICE / IME structure ID_2 or ID_3, please manually check.

Could not choose assigning between upstream or downstream integrases CDR20291_RS09685, CDR20291_RS09810 to structure ID_4, please manually check.
